# Videoflix Backend

This is the backend to the project lualflix.

## Considerations

Is needed to create a structure where the videos and the images has been saved in the project

### Estructure

You need to create the upload estructure

```
videoflix-cms
  |__src
    |__uploads
      |__videos
        |__movie
        |__tv
      |__images
        |__movie
          |__backdrop
          |__poster
        |__tv
          |__backdrop
          |__poster
```

### `.env`

You need to crate an env file in the root folder with the follow variables


```
# Database Info
USER_DB='user'
PASSWORD_DB='examplePassword'
URL_DB='localhost:27017'
# URL to provide the resources
API_URL='http://localhost:5000'
```

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
